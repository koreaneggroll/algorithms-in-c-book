#C

    The programming language used throughout this course is C. All languages have their good and bad points, and thus
the choice of any particular language for a course like this has advantages and disadvantages. But many modern programming
languages are similar, so by using relatively few languages constructs and avoiding implementation decisions based on pecularities of C,
we develop programs that are easily translated into other languages. Our goal is to present the algorithms in as simple and direct form as possible; C allows us to do this.


    The book actually covers a little bit of C concepts, I won't sadly. This requires at least a basic understanding of C.
