##Algorithms

        In writing a computer program, one is generally implementing a method of solving
    a problem that has been devised previously. This method is often independent of the particular
    computer to be used; it's likely to be equally appropriate for many computers. In any case, it is the method, not the computer itself,
    which must be studied to learn how the problem is being attacked. The term algorithm is used in C.S to describe a problem-solving
    method suitable for implementation as computer programs. Algorithms are the "stuff" of computer science.



##Brief Explanation of what we will go over

    * FUNDAMENTALS in the context of this are tools and methods used throughout the later chapters.

    * SORTING methods for rearranging files into order are of fundamental importance and are covered in some depth.

    * SEARCHING methods for finding things in the files are also fundamental importance. We disscuss basic and advanced methods for searching using trees and digital keys transformations, including binary search trees, balanced trees, hashing, digital search trees and tries, and methods appropriate for very large files.

    * STRING PROCESSING algorithms include a range of methods for dealing with (long) sequences of characters. String searching leads to pattern mathing which leads to parsing.

    * GEOMETRICAL ALGORITHMS are a collection of methods for solving problems involving points and lines (and other simple geometric objects) that have recently come into use.

    * GRAPH ALGORITHMS are useful for a variety of difficult and important problems. A general strategy for searching in graphs is developed and aplied to fundamental connectivity problems, including shortest path, minimum spanning tree, network flow, and matching.

    * MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS include fundamental methods from arithmetic and numerical analysis. We study methods for arithmetic with integers, polynomials, and matrices as well as algorithms for solving a variety of mathematical problems that arise in many contexts: random number generation, solution of simoultaneous questions, data fitting and integration.

    * ADVANCED TOPICS are discussed for the purpose of relating the material in the book to several other advanced fields of studies.
