##Algorithms

        In writing a computer program, one is generally implementing a method of solving
    a problem that has been devised previously. This method is often independent of the particular
    computer to be used; it's likely to be equally appropriate for many computers. In any case, it is the method, not the computer itself,
    which must be studied to learn how the problem is being attacked. The term algorithm is used in C.S to describe a problem-solving
    method suitable for implementation as computer programs. Algorithms are the "stuff" of computer science.
